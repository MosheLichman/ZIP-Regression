# ZIP-Regression
My code for fixed-effect Zero-Inflated Poisson Regression model.

This code is part of my work on the Prediction of Sparse User-Item Consumption Rate.

As such, it means that it's an academic code. I've done a lot of work to make it super efficient and I believe there are more 
comments in the code than actual code, but I'm sure more could have been done.

## Dependencies
1. numpy and scipy
2. pandas
3. cython

You will need to run the setup.py code first by running the line python setup.py build_ext --inplace.
